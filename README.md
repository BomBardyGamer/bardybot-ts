# Discord test bot

A simple bot I created whilst learning how to use Discord.JS and TypeScript.

### Running

Use `npm run start` or `npm start` to start the bot. Make sure to provide your token in a
top-level `config.json`, like so:
```json
{
    "token": "my-token"
}
```

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and even encouraged, as my code is probably kinda whack.
